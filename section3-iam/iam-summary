Identity Access Management 101 Summary

What have we learnt so far?

* IAM consists of the following:
  - Users
  - Groups (a way to group users and apply policies collectively)
  - Roles
  - Policy Documents (json, key value pairs: attributes, value)

* IAM is universal, does not apply to regions

* the 'root account' is the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete admin access

* new users have no permission when first created

* new users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created

* These are not the same as a password, and you can't use the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to Login to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and command line.

* you only get to view credentials one. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So save them in a secure location.

* always set up multifactor authentication on your root account

* you can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
