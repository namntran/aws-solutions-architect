S3 101

* S3 stands for Simple Storage Service

* provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web

* is a safe place to store files

* object based storage (videos, photos, pdf, word documents - flat files vs block based - operating system or database)

* data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to withstand failure

* cloudberry labs - windows file explorer for S3 https://www.cloudberrylab.com/explorer/amazon-s3.aspx

* S3 is object based i.e. allows you to upload files

* files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB

* unlimited storage

* files are stored in buckets

* S3 is universal namespace, names must be unique globally

* buckets - region then bucket names

* when you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if upload was successful

Data Consistency Model for S3

* read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects (immediately read an object on update)

* eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (updating an object can take some time to propogate)

* updates are atomic - get new or old version, not corrupted data

S3 is a simple key, value store

* S3 is object based. Objects consist of the following:
  - key (file name of object)
  - value (data made up of bytes)
  - version ID (versioning)
  - metadata (data about data)
  - subresources 
    * access control lists (fine grain permissions, objects, files, buckets)
    * Torrent

* Amazon SLA guarantee S3 built for 99.99% availability

* 11 X 9s durability for S3 informations

* tiered storage available

* lifecycle management

* versioning (one object with multiple versions)

* encryption

* secure data using access control lists and bucket policies

Storage Tiers

* S3 - 99.99% availability, 11 x 9s durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

* S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)for data that is accessed less frequently (e.g payroll data/ wage slips needed at year end), but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee

* RRS - Reduced Redundancy Storage - designed to provide 99.99% durability and availability of objects (e.g data that can be generated again, e.g thumbnails)

* Glacier - very cheap, but used for archival only. It takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier.

* Glacier is its own service - stores data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month and is optimised for data that is infrequently accessed.

S3 Charges
  - storage
  - requests
  - storage management pricing (metadata)
  - data transfer pricing
  - transfer acceleration

* Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration - enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. 

*Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimised network path.
