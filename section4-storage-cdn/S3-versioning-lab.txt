S3 - Versioning Lab

* stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)

* great backup tool

* once enabled, versioning can't be disabled, only suspended

* integrates with Lifecycle rules

* Versioning's "MFA delete capability", which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security
