Security Groups Lab

* A security group is a virtual firewall
 - controls traffic to your instances
 - 1 instance can have multiple security groups
 - add rules to each security groups that allows traffic to instances

* any rule you make to security group happens immediately

* security groups are stateful - any inbound rules would automatically add outbound rules

SUMMARY
* all inbound traffic is blocked by default

* all outbound traffic is allowed

* changes to security groups take effect immediately

* you can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group

* you can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances

* security groups are STATEFUL
  - If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in (e.g HTTP, SSH, HTTPS etc), it automatically adds an outbound rule (that outbound traffic is automatically allowed back out again).

* explain the difference between a security groups (STATEFUL) and network access control (STATELESS)? 

* you can't block specific IP addresses using security groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists

* you can specify allow rules, but not deny rules (by default, nothing is allowed)

* in terminal, change directory to Downloads/ SSH, then enter:

  $ ssh ec2-user@[IPv4 Public IP] -i MyEC2KeyPair.pem
