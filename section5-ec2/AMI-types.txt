AMI Types

(EBS vs Instance Store)

* You can select your AMI based on:
  - Regions
  - Operating system
  - Architecture (32 bit or 64 bit)
  - Launch Permissions
  - Storage for the Root Device (Root Device Volumes)
    - Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE - less durability)
    - EBS Backed Volumes

* Critcal differnce between and Instance Store and EBS Backed Voume is that with an Instance Store, you cannot stop an instance (only Reboot or Terminate). 

SUMMARY

* All AMIs are categorised as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance store.

* For EBS Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.

* For Instance Store Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored iin S3.

EXAM TIPS

* Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage

* Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.

* EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.

* You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.

* By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
