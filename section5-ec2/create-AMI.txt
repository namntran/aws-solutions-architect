AMI - Amazon Machine Image
Encrypted Root Device
Volumes & Snapshots - Lab

* EC2 Dashboard - Stop Instance, Create Snapshot 'MyRootDeviceVolume'

* In Snapshot menu, copy snapshot to different region

* AMIs are not encrypted at REST, encryption key is held in your AWS account (always private)

SUMMARY

* To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.

* You can share snapshots, but only if they are unecrypted.
  - These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public. 

* Case scenario and real world - create a web server with all your programs configured to your specifications(apache, security, base web code installed etc). You can create a snapshot of this base image, then promote that snapshot to an Amazon Machine Image, and boot similar web servers. 

So next time you provision an EC2 image, you won't need to install programs (apache, security etc).
