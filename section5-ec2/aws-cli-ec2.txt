The AWS Command Line & EC2

* CLI is unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

* The AWS CLI introduces a new set of simple file commands for efficient file transfers to and from Amazon S3.

* Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. If you don't have access keys, you can create them by using the AWS Management Console. We recommend that you use IAM access keys instead of AWS root account access keys. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account.

Command Structure in the AWS Command Line Interface

* The AWS CLI uses a multipart structure on the command line. It starts with the base call to aws. The next part specifies a top-level command, which often represents an AWS service supported in the AWS CLI. Each AWS service has additional subcommands that specify the operation to perform. The general CLI options, or the specific parameters for an operation, can be specified on the command line in any order. If an exclusive parameter is specified multiple times, then only the last value applies.

$ aws <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]

* Parameters can take various types of input values, such as numbers, strings, lists, maps, and JSON structures.
