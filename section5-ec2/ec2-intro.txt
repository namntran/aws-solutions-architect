EC2 Introduction

* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

* EC2 is a web service that provides reliable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and dwown, as your computing requirements change.

* EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applicaitons and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

EC2 Options
* On Demand - allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
* Reserved - provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discout on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.
* Spot - enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
* Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

On Demand
* users want low cost and flexibility without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
* applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
* applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time

Reserved
* applications with steady state or predictable usage (e.g 10 000 active users)
* applications that require reserved capacity
* users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

Spot
* like stockmarket (spot/stock price depending on availability)
* applications that have flexible start and end times
* applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices 
* users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

Dedicated Hosts
* useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualisation
* great for licensing with does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
* can be purchased on-demand (hourly)
* can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

*If the spot instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.
