Volumes and Snapshots Lab

* create new volume

* in terminal, change directory to Downloads/ SSH, then enter:

  $ ssh ec2-user@[IPv4 Public IP] -i MyEC2KeyPair.pem

2 package(s) needed for security, out of 2 available
Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.

* elevate privileges to root
  
  $ sudo su

* list all virtual disks

  $lsblk

NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0    8G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0    8G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0  500G  0 disk 

* check if volume has any data on it

  $ file -s /dev/xvdf

* currently raw storage, need to format. need to make filesystem, type, file system in linux, mount point

  $ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

* need to mount the disk to the path, and to the directory

  $ mount /dev/xvdf /myfileserver 

* change directory to file server

  $ cd /myfileserver

* create a file

  $ nano index.html

* unmount disk

  $ umount /dev/xvdf

[root@ip-172-31-13-230 /]# lsblk

* In AWS console, detach volume. Then Create Snapshot of volume.

* Snapshots are a point in time (photographs) of the virtual hard disk. This snapshot will be stored on S3. Every time you take a new snapshot, only the data that is change is stored on S3. So it's incremental updates. Every snapshot won't be storing 500 GB, only the changed data.

SUMMARY
 
* Volumes exist on Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
  - EBS Volume are virtual hard disk attached to EC2 instance
  - Root device volume is volume that an operating system is installed on to (Linux, Windows)
  - Snapshots exist on S3
  - Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes (taking a photo of the disk)
  - Snapshots are incremental, this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapsot are moved to S3.
